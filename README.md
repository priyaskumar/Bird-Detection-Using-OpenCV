# Bird detection :

  A possible solution to avoid airplane nightmare.

# Directions:

  1) Download the project to your PC.
  
  2) Install OpenCV 

      ```
      pip install opencv-python
      ```

  3) Run the Bird_detection.py file on your terminal.  
     > - You can use web-cam for real-time detection just by changing the video name in the python file with 0   
     > - 0 is the default web-cam number if you are connected to only one

# Description and working:

  * This model works both on preloaded video as well as on web-cam in real time. 
  
  * This project is based on Haar-cascade and therefore the central focus is to build the cascade file(xml file). 
  
  * Create the haar cascade that reads the properties of objects to be detected from an already made xml file.
  
  * The xml file is generated as a result of machine learning from all possible object samples provided.
